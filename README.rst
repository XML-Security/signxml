SignXML: XML Signature in Python
================================
*SignXML* is an implementation of the W3C `XML Signature <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Signature>`_ standard in
Python. This standard (also known as XMLDSig and `RFC 3275 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3275.txt>`_) is used to provide
payload security in `SAML 2.0 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0>`_, among other uses.  Three versions of the
standard exist (`Version 1 "Second Edition" <http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/>`_, `Version 1.1
<http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core1/>`_, and `Version 2.0 <http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core2>`_). *SignXML* implements
all of the required components of the standard, and most recommended ones. Its features are:

* Use of `defusedxml.lxml <https://bitbucket.org/tiran/defusedxml>`_ to defend against common XML-based attacks when
  verifying signatures
* Extensions to allow signing with and verifying X.509 certificate chains, including hostname/CN validation
* Support for exclusive XML canonicalization with inclusive prefixes (`InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList
  <http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-exc-c14n/#def-InclusiveNamespaces-PrefixList>`_, required to verify signatures generated by
  some SAML implementations)
* Modern Python compatibility (2.7-3.4+ and PyPy)
* Well-supported, portable, reliable dependencies: `lxml <https://github.com/lxml/lxml>`_, `defusedxml
  <https://bitbucket.org/tiran/defusedxml>`_, `cryptography <https://github.com/pyca/cryptography>`_, `eight
  <https://github.com/kislyuk/eight>`_, `pyOpenSSL <https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl>`_
* Comprehensive testing (including the XMLDSig interoperability suite) and `continuous integration
  <https://travis-ci.org/kislyuk/signxml>`_
* Simple interface with useful defaults
* Compactness, readability, and extensibility

Installation
------------
::

    pip install signxml

Note: SignXML depends on `lxml <https://github.com/lxml/lxml>`_ and `cryptography
<https://github.com/pyca/cryptography>`_, which in turn depend on `OpenSSL <https://www.openssl.org/>`_, `LibXML
<http://xmlsoft.org/>`_, and Python tools to interface with them. You can install those as follows:

**Ubuntu, Python 2**::

    apt-get install python-dev python-cffi libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libssl-dev

**Ubuntu, Python 3**::

    apt-get install python3-dev python3-cffi libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libssl-dev

**Ubuntu 12.04:** ``python-cffi`` is not available on 12.04. Use ``apt-get install libffi-dev`` followed by
``pip install cffi``.

**OS X**: Use `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_::

    brew install libxml2 libxslt
    brew link --force libxml2 libxslt

Synopsis
--------

SignXML uses the ElementTree API (also supported by lxml) to work with XML data.

.. code-block:: python

    from signxml import xmldsig

    cert = open("example.pem").read()
    key = open("example.key").read()
    root = ElementTree.fromstring(signature_data)
    signed_root = xmldsig(root).sign(key=key, cert=cert)
    verified_data = xmldsig(signed_root).verify()

Verifying SAML assertions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assuming ``metadata.xml`` contains SAML metadata for the assertion source:

.. code-block:: python

    from lxml import etree
    from base64 import b64decode
    from signxml import xmldsig

    with open("metadata.xml", "rb") as fh:
        cert = etree.parse(fh).find("//ds:X509Certificate").text

    assertion_data = xmldsig(b64decode(assertion_body)).verify(x509_cert=cert)

.. admonition:: Signing SAML assertions

 The SAML assertion schema specifies a location for the enveloped XML signature (between ``<Issuer>`` and
 ``<Subject>``). To sign a SAML assertion in a schema-compliant way, insert a signature placeholder tag at that location
 before calling xmldsig: ``<ds:Signature Id="placeholder"></ds:Signature>``.

.. admonition:: See what is signed

 It is important to understand and follow the best practice rule of "See what is signed" when verifying XML
 signatures. The gist of this rule is: if your application neglects to verify that the information it trusts is
 what was actually signed, the attacker can supply a valid signature but point you to malicious data that wasn't signed
 by that signature.

 In SignXML, you can ensure that the information signed is what you expect to be signed by only trusting the
 data returned by the ``verify()`` method. The return value is the XML node or string that was signed.

XML signature methods: enveloped, detached, enveloping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The XML Signature specification defines three ways to compose a signature with the data being signed: enveloped,
detached, and enveloping signature. Enveloped is the default method. To specify the type of signature that you want to
generate, pass the ``method`` argument to ``sign()``:

.. code-block:: python

    signed_root = xmldsig(root).sign(method=signxml.methods.detached, key=key, cert=cert)
    verified_data = xmldsig(signed_root).verify()

For detached signatures, the code above will use the ``Id`` or ``ID`` attribute of ``root`` to generate a relative URI
(``<Reference URI="#value"``). You can also override the value of ``URI`` by passing a ``reference_uri`` argument to
``sign()``.

To verify a detached signature that refers to an external entity, pass a callable resolver in
``xmldsig.verify(uri_resolver=...)``.
